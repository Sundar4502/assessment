# Simple Responsive Data Grid

This repository contains a basic implementation of a responsive data grid using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The grid allows users to view, search, add, and delete rows of data.

## Features

- *Search*: Users can search for specific data entries by typing into the search input field. The grid updates dynamically to display only the rows matching the search query.

- *Add Row*: Users can add new rows to the grid by clicking the "Add Row" button. This inserts a blank row into the grid, allowing users to input new data.

- *Delete Row*: Each row has a delete button associated with it. Clicking the delete button removes the corresponding row from the grid.
